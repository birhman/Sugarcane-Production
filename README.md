Sugarcane Production Analysis

Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of global sugarcane production across various countries and continents. Through data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis, we uncover trends and insights that highlight production capacities, acreage, yield rates, and per capita production.

Data Sources

The dataset used in this project, "List of Countries by Sugarcane Production," contains the following columns:

Country: Country name

Continent: Continent where the country is located

Production (Tons): Total sugarcane production (in tons)

Production per Person (Kg): Production per capita (in kilograms)

Acreage (Hectare): Land area dedicated to sugarcane farming (in hectares)

Yield (Kg / Hectare): Yield per hectare (in kilograms)


Project Structure

Data Cleaning: Steps taken to remove null values, handle special characters, and rename columns for easier analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing production metrics and identifying trends across continents and countries.

Visualizations: Creating charts and graphs for a visual understanding of key insights.


Installation and Setup

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary libraries:

git clone [repo-url]
cd [repo-name]
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

1. Load the dataset and follow the steps in the notebook to clean and preprocess the data.


2. Analyze trends and gain insights using the code provided.


3. Visualize the results using the seaborn and matplotlib libraries.



Code Highlights

Some of the key operations performed:

Data Cleaning: Converted columns with non-standard formats to numeric values, handled missing data, and renamed columns.

Statistical Analysis: Conducted various statistics on production metrics to compare productivity across countries.

Visualizations: Generated plots for understanding patterns in production, yield, and acreage.


Example Insights

Top Producers: Identify countries with the highest sugarcane production.

Yield Comparison: Compare yield rates across continents to evaluate productivity.

Acreage vs. Production: Determine if larger land area correlates with higher production volumes.


Future Work

Potential areas for further research include:

Analyzing changes in production over time

Assessing the impact of climate on yield rates

Comparing sugarcane production with other agricultural crops for broader agricultural insights
